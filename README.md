# Stay Up to Date on Tech Blog
- I was tasked with creating a tech news blog that uses the model view controller layout and handlebars for templating the various pages on the site
- This site allows the user to create or login an account on the site and create/view posts from the db
- The user can edit their own posts content or delete the post. 
- As well, the user can leave comments on other posts
